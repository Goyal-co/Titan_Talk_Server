        Salesperson: Hi ${recording.name}, this is ${recording.userName} calling about our premium property project.
        We have excellent 3 & 3.5 BHK apartments in Whitefield, near Nexus Mall.
        The starting price is ‚Çπ2.2 Cr with possession by 2028.
        
        Customer: That sounds interesting, but the price seems quite high for our budget.
        
        Salesperson: I understand your concern about the pricing. Let me explain the value proposition.
        The location in Whitefield is prime real estate, and being near Nexus Mall adds great convenience.
        We also offer flexible payment plans to make it more affordable.
        
        Customer: What about smaller units? Do you have 2 BHK options?
        
        Salesperson: Currently we only have 3 & 3.5 BHK units available. However, the 3 BHK is quite 
        reasonably sized and offers excellent value for the location. Would you like to schedule a site visit?
        
        Customer: Let me think about it and discuss with my family.
        
        Salesperson: Absolutely! I'll send you the brochure and we can schedule a visit when convenient.
