  It's located in Whitefield, close to Nexus Mall. We have 3 & 3.5 BHK options starting from ‚Çπ2.2 Cr.
  Possession is in 2028. Would you be interested in a site visit?
  
  Customer: That sounds interesting, but the price seems a bit high for our budget.
  
  Salesperson: I understand your concern about the price. Let me explain the value proposition. The location in Whitefield is prime real estate, and being near Nexus Mall adds convenience. Plus, we're offering flexible payment plans.
  
  Customer: What about 2 BHK options? We don't need such a large space.
  
  Salesperson: Currently we only have 3 & 3.5 BHK units available. However, the 3 BHK is quite reasonably sized and offers great value for the location.`;
